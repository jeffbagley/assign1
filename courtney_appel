This will be my third year in the computer science program here
but this year I decided to add some ITS classes to my schedule in 
hopes of completing the Network Administration program offered through
the Missoula college. It will be a lot of biking back and forth but 
I'm looking forward to my classes there. When I'm not doing school
work I enjoy reading books, watching movies and binge watching tv
series. I am currently reading the Stand by Stephen King and am eager
to see Murder on the Orient Express and It when they get to theaters
as well as binge watch the new season of Stranger Things when it comes
out!
Unfortunately my schedule is kind of a mess right now due to a time
change of one of my Missoula College classes that now overlaps with 
the Thursday session of this class. Hopefully I get it worked out soon
though.
